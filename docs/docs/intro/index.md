# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

## Welcome to the Future of Robotics

Welcome to an exciting journey into the world of Physical AI and humanoid robotics! This book is designed to guide you through the fundamental concepts, practical implementations, and cutting-edge techniques required to build autonomous humanoid robots capable of understanding and executing voice commands in simulated environments.

## What You'll Learn

In this comprehensive guide, you'll explore four core modules that form the foundation of modern humanoid robotics:

1. **ROS 2 Nervous System** - Learn how to create the communication backbone that enables different robot components to work together seamlessly
2. **Digital Twin** - Build physics-accurate simulation environments that mirror real-world robot behavior
3. **AI-Robot Brain** - Implement intelligent decision-making systems that process sensor data and generate appropriate responses
4. **Vision-Language-Action Pipeline** - Create systems that can interpret visual input and voice commands to perform complex tasks

## The Autonomous Humanoid Challenge

Our ultimate goal is to create a humanoid robot that can understand and execute commands like:
- "Move forward 2 meters"
- "Pick up the red cube on the left"
- "Navigate to the kitchen and bring me a cup"

These capabilities require integrating multiple complex systems, which is exactly what you'll build step by step.

## Prerequisites

Before diving in, you should have:
- Basic programming experience (Python preferred)
- Understanding of fundamental robotics concepts
- Familiarity with Linux/Ubuntu environment
- Interest in AI and machine learning concepts

## Technology Stack

We'll be using industry-standard tools:
- **ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill** - Robot Operating System for communication and control
- **Gazebo** - Physics simulation environment
- **Python 3.8+** - Primary programming language
- **Docusaurus** - Documentation framework
- **FastAPI** - Backend API framework
- **Qdrant** - Vector database for RAG system

## Getting Started

Each module includes:
- Theoretical foundations
- Practical code examples
- Simulation exercises
- Debugging scenarios
- Integration challenges

Let's begin by exploring the nervous system of our robot - the ROS 2 communication framework that enables all components to work together harmoniously.
